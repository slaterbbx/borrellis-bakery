## ðŸ’¯ Borrelli's Bakery Website
The main focus of this project was to build a highly efficient, fast, reliable and future proof website for the client. We needed some method to manage some ever chainging content, ie. products and descriptions. SEO was imperitive due to the nature of the company and its target demographic. The choice was made to go with a JAM stack build that is automatically re-built upon changes in the chosen CMS platform. I chose prismic due to its simple user interface / graphQL endpoint and ability to send out a webhook upon publishing. Prismic is also a CDN ( content delivery network ) but for this project that really does not matter to us. We will only be loading content from prismic during re-build time, saving all images and data locally so that we serve up a static website 100% of the time to our visitors while still getting the benifits of a CMS type management system for our website content. Firebase was chosen for the hosting mainly because it provides the needed options to expand to a custom client user portal and backend later with firebase database and firebase functions. Travis-CI for CI / CD due to its simplicity and integration with gitHub.

## ðŸ’ª Project outline details ( some things are still being added )
- **JAM** stack
- Gatsby.js ( speed )
- Prismic.io CMS ( content managment and deliver method for build time using graphQl endpoint )
	- Note: This will be added soon
- Firebase ( Hosting and automated deployment using Travis-ci and a webhook from prismic.io)
- Continous integration
	- Re-build and deployment on master codebranch updates or pull request, only if accepted and merged with master
- Continous deployment
- Automated static website re-build and deployment
	- CDN content managment backend hosted by prismic.io ( graphQL )
  	* Data is downloaded from the CDN on build time only and served locally on deployment
		* No missing data from search engine crawlers
		* Optimal design for SEO and performance
- Context based global state management
- Multi page app with a SPA feel
- Modern hook based react design
- Strong UI / UX focus
- Strong focus on optimization
- User accessability best practices
	- Mobile first ( not yet converted )
	- Proper Tabbable navigation ( still work in progress )
	- Rem based global scaling for Zoom / based on browser default font size
	- Em based media breakpoints
- Minimal dependancies ( all page transitions are coded within the project )
- Styled-components ðŸ’… for the **WIN**

## ðŸŽ“ Resources
These are the resources to help you understand how the CI / CD pipeline with static re-build is being handled.  
https://www.gatsbyjs.org/

#### Prismic CDN with Gatsby.js plugin for content integration on build time
I chose prismic for a few reasons. Mainly because it has free tooling to help me integrate with my CI / CD pipeline. Prismic actually has a plugin for gatsby that helps manage the remote data download and project content localization on build time. This plugin also allows for an automated "preview" method, that will display the remote content instead of the localized version, giving you live content during development on special "/preview" pages. This preview can also be used before you trigger a release during production to view the website updates. Prismic also has a webhook that can be used to trigger website rebuilds, the rebuild downloads and localizes the content, builds the updated static website, then we deploy a new version to firebase via Travis-ci.

#### CI / CD with travis-ci
Check out the `.travis.yml` in the ./root directory of the project. Here you will see how we are building and deploying from travis-ci to firebase webhosting. Most of the comments like `# - cd functions && npm install` are in regards to if you need to also deploy firebase functions with your project. 
**NOTE:** With this type of deployment it is advised to turn off "Build pushed pull request" in your travis-ci project settings on a public repository, since this will cause your site to build and deploy others changes to firebase hosting.

#### Pipedream.com custom workflow / travis-ci re-build trigger on prismic.io content changes:
> Fires a Webhook POST request from prismic backend to Pipedream which trigger a POST request to Travis-ci to trigger a rebuild and deployment to firebase hosting.

You need to first generate ( requires installing travis CLI and Ruby ) or you can get a token from your user settings page when logged into travic-ci.com and the value for Authorization should be ( token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE )
